Multithreaded Proxy Server using Java
Overview
This project is a Multithreaded Proxy Server built in Java that efficiently handles multiple client requests by forwarding them to the destination servers and relaying responses back to the clients. The server operates in a multithreaded environment, allowing concurrent handling of multiple client connections, improving performance and responsiveness.

Features
Multithreaded: Handles multiple clients simultaneously using Java threads.
Forwarding Requests: Acts as an intermediary between client and server, forwarding HTTP requests.
Connection Pooling: Reuses connections to improve efficiency.
Logging: Records incoming requests and outgoing responses for debugging and analytics purposes.
Configurable Ports and Timeout: Allows customization of listening ports and timeout periods.
Filtering and Caching (Optional): Implement content filtering or caching mechanisms to improve performance and security.
How it Works
The proxy server listens for incoming client requests on a specified port.
Once a request is received, the server spawns a new thread to handle that client request.
The thread parses the client request, connects to the target server, forwards the request, and retrieves the serverâ€™s response.
The server then relays the response back to the client while logging the request and response details.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/multithreaded-proxy-server.git
Compile the code: Navigate to the project directory and compile the Java files using the following command:

bash
Copy code
javac ProxyServer.java
Run the server: To start the server, execute the following command:

bash
Copy code
java ProxyServer <port_number>
Replace <port_number> with the port on which you want the proxy server to listen (e.g., 8080).

Usage
Configure your client (browser or application) to use the proxy server by specifying the IP address and the port number where the proxy server is running.
The proxy server will intercept the requests, forward them to the target servers, and then return the responses to the client.
Configuration
Port Number: You can specify the port number as a command-line argument when running the proxy server.
Timeout: Modify the timeout duration in the ProxyServer.java file to handle slow server responses effectively.
Thread Pooling: The server can be extended to use a thread pool for better resource management.
Example
To run the proxy server on port 8080:

bash
Copy code
java ProxyServer 8080
Configure your browser or HTTP client to use localhost:8080 as the proxy server, and all HTTP requests will pass through the proxy.

Future Improvements
SSL Support: Extend the proxy server to handle HTTPS requests by implementing SSL tunneling.
Caching: Implement caching of frequently accessed resources to reduce load times and bandwidth usage.
Authentication: Add support for basic authentication to restrict access to the proxy server.
