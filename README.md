# Multithreaded Proxy Server using Java

## Overview
This project is a Multithreaded Proxy Server built in Java that efficiently handles multiple client requests by forwarding them to the destination servers and relaying responses back to the clients. The server operates in a multithreaded environment, allowing concurrent handling of multiple client connections, improving performance and responsiveness.

## Features
- **Multithreaded**: Handles multiple clients simultaneously using Java threads.
- **Forwarding Requests**: Acts as an intermediary between client and server, forwarding HTTP requests.
- **Connection Pooling**: Reuses connections to improve efficiency.
- **Logging**: Records incoming requests and outgoing responses for debugging and analytics purposes.
- **Configurable Ports and Timeout**: Allows customization of listening ports and timeout periods.
- **Filtering and Caching (Optional)**: Implement content filtering or caching mechanisms to improve performance and security.

## How it Works
1. The proxy server listens for incoming client requests on a specified port.
2. Once a request is received, the server spawns a new thread to handle that client request.
3. The thread parses the client request, connects to the target server, forwards the request, and retrieves the serverâ€™s response.
4. The server then relays the response back to the client while logging the request and response details.

## Installation
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/multithreaded-proxy-server.git

Compile the code: Navigate to the project directory and compile the Java files using the following command:

javac ProxyServer.java
